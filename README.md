## Platform/Technologies:
- [Electron](https://electronjs.org) (our software framework)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (our javascript runtime)
- [eslint](https://eslint.org) (our linting utility)
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) (our continuous integration service)
- [Jest](http://jestjs.io) (our javascript testing framework)

## Run Instructions
``` 
git clone https://github.com/badgerloop-software/pod-dashboard.git
cd pod-dashboard/src
npm install
npm start
```

## Testing &nbsp; [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/badgerloop-software/pod-dashboard.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/badgerloop-software/pod-dashboard)
- Configured with eslint for formatting tests
- Configured with jest for unit testing and coverage
- CI handled by Travis

It is currently configured to run a pretest that uses eslint to check for any formating and stylistic errors. If that passes without any issues, then it runs jest which completes all unit tests that are setup (none except for a test called add.js for now) and then displays the coverage (what percent is unit tested). Travis will run automatically on any commit, and before a pull request to check that all checks passed.

### Some commands to know:
To run just lint: 
```
npm run pretest
```
or 
```
npn run lint
```
To run lint on a certian file
```
eslint [file].js [dir]
```
To have lint fix some errors automatically (good for spacing issues)
```
npm run pretest -- --fix
```
\
To run just coverage test:
```  
npm run coverage
```
\
To run lint and unit tests with coverage: 
```
npm test
```
\

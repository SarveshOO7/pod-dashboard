## How to export

There is an "Archive Data" button in the control panel. Clicking that will dump the cache into a JSON file in this folder.

## Naming

(Date)(Hour)(Minute)(Second).JSON

## Viewing Exported Data in Dashboard

In the top right corner of the dashboard there is the option to change views. Switch to analysis. Then in the upper left you will see a load file button. This allows you to load any run data into the native viewer.

## Converting to Excel

You can do this any way you wish, but [https://sqlify.io/convert/json/to/csv](https://sqlify.io/convert/json/to/csv) works great.
